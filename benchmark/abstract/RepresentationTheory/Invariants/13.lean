Lemma ideas revolve around:

* `GroupAlgebra.average`: its algebraic properties, interaction with representations,
  tensor products, duals, subrepresentations, quotients.
* `Representation.invariants`: lattice properties, functoriality, compatibility with
  direct sums, tensor products, duals, restriction/induction, quotient representations,
  and categorical properties in `Rep` and `FDRep`.
* `linHom.invariantsEquivRepHom`: naturality, behavior under composition, etc.
* Interaction with other Mathlib structures: `LinearEquiv`, `Submodule`, `Subrepresentation`,
  categorical functors, adjunction properties, traces, characters (where available), etc.

All lemmas below are just statements with `sorry`. They are intended to be nontrivial
(i.e. not immediate from simp-like automation).
