The following are brainstormed lemma statements that might be useful in Mathlib,
inspired by the optional stopping theorem file and its interactions with other areas.
They are intentionally left with `sorry` proofs.

  -- The stopped value of the constant-zero process is identically zero.
  -- Thus both sides are the same integral of the zero function.
