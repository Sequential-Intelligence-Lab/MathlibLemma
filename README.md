Official repository for the paper **"MathlibLemma: Folklore Lemma Generation and Benchmark for Formal Mathematics"**.

This repository contains **MathlibLemma**, a dataset of synthesized "folklore" lemmas that bridge the gap between high-level intuition and formal verification in Lean 4. It serves both as a library of verified theorems and a benchmark for evaluating the formal reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main components:

- **`benchmark/`**: Contains the **4,028 type-checked statements** (without proofs). These serve as the test set for auto-formalization and theorem proving tasks.
- **`lemma/`**: Contains the **1,812 formally verified theorems** (with complete proofs generated by our pipeline).

Each component is categorized into three domains based on the complexity and abstraction level of the mathematics:

| Directory | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| `foundational/` | This domain covers the “bread and butter” of formalized mathematics: real analysis, discrete structures (e.g., sets, matrices), basic probability, and others. |
| `applied/` | This domain includes domains such as advanced probability (martingales), information theory, and convex analysis. |
| `abstract/` | This domain spans abstract fields including category theory, algebraic topology, and differential geometry. |

## 🚀 Usage

This is a standard Lean 4 project. To build the project and verify the lemmas:

1. **Install Lean 4**: Follow the instructions at [leanprover-community/lean4](https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean4).
2. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sequential-Intelligence-Lab/MathlibLemma.git
   cd MathlibLemma
   ```
3. **Get dependencies**:
   ```bash
   lake exe cache get
   ```
4. **Build**:
   ```bash
   lake build
   ```

## 🏆 Merged Contributions to Mathlib

A key contribution of this project is the discovery of missing lemmas that have been accepted into the official Mathlib library. Below are the representative merged Pull Requests:

* [Mathlib4 PR #32170](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/32170)
  - Adds `gronwallBound_mono`: `gronwallBound` is monotone non-decreasing in time `x` (given non-negative parameters `δ`, `ε`, `K`).

* [Mathlib4 PR #32167](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/32167)
  - Adds `Kernel.restrict_const`: restricting a constant kernel to a measurable set commutes with restricting the underlying measure.

* [Mathlib4 PR #31985](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/31985)
  - Adds `centralMoment_congr_ae`: central moments agree for a.e.-equal random variables.
